- [ ] cooler blur modern background
- [ ] dark / light mode
- [ ] wide table x-scroll issue
- [ ] top bar icon (with show/hide effect)
- [ ] multi windows (all anchored by openclose shortcut; with consistent z ordering)
- [ ] get web search tool use for openai / gemini

# Test

- [ ] test on multiple devices to see if loads
- [ ] test on windows
- [~] test on linux
    - missing libs on appimage
- [ ] support for more llm providers (or at least test/check current provider options)

# LongTerm

- [ ] Voice mode (with Whisper)
- [ ] Full operating system control (open apps, etc)
- [ ] maybe switch to react since LLMs seem better at coding React that Svelte
