- [ ] multi windows (all anchored by openclose shortcut; with consistent z ordering)
- [ ] cooler blur modern background

# Test

- [ ] test on multiple devices to see if loads
- [ ] test on windows
- [~] test on linux
    - missing libs on appimage
- [ ] support for more llm providers (or at least test/check current provider options)

# LongTerm

- [ ] Full operating system control (open apps, etc)
- [ ] maybe switch to react since LLMs seem better at coding React that Svelte
